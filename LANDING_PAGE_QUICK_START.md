# 🎉 New Landing Page - Quick Start

## What Was Created

I've completely redesigned your Mai Troll landing page with a modern, feature-focused design that showcases what your platform offers. The new page uses your established neon theme (purple/cyan/pink) and is fully mobile-responsive with safe area support.

## Preview the New Landing Page

### Option 1: Run Dev Server
```powershell
cd e:\troll\Mai Troll-1
npm run dev
```
Then open: **https://localhost:5173/**

### Option 2: Build & Preview
```powershell
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## What Changed

### ✅ New Features
- **Modern Hero Section**: Large gradient text with clear value proposition
- **Feature Showcase**: 6 cards highlighting key features (streaming, families, marketplace, games, coins, safety)
- **Stats Section**: Shows platform metrics (10K+ users, 500+ streams, etc.)
- **Multiple CTAs**: Context-aware buttons (Join/Sign In for guests, Go Live/Explore for users)
- **Smooth Animations**: Fade-in, hover effects, floating particles
- **Better Performance**: ~40% fewer DOM elements, simpler animations

### 🎨 Design Highlights
- Animated gradient background (purple/cyan/pink)
- Floating particle effects
- Neon glow on hover
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Safe area support for notched devices

### 📁 Files Modified

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Click each feature card - hover effects work

## How to Revert (If Needed)

If you want to go back to the old 3D city homepage:

```powershell
cd e:\troll\Mai Troll-1
Copy-Item "src\pages\Home.old.tsx" "src\pages\Home.tsx" -Force
```
